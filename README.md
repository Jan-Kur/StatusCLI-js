## Usage

Install with
```bash
npm install -g status-cli
```

Then just run to use the cli
```bash
status-cli
```

## Note

After pasting in the copied code if it's not displayed in full in the text input, please delete it and paste it again until it's visible in full. This text input is sloppy.

Also, you can either input an emoji in the string format eg. ```:eyes:``` or copy and paste the emoji itself eg. ðŸ‘€ if your terminal supports it.
